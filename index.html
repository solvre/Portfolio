                    <p>Housemate HQ is a tool for student housings to get to know each other in a low stress environment. Essentially it’s a <b>Speed friending</b> application to reach out and match based off of interests and create activities with your new friends.</p>

                    <h3>Why?</h3>
                    <p>As we’ve seen and researched a <b>decrease in attendance</b> for social events and an increase in <b>self-isolation</b>, we wanted to <b>lower the threshhold</b> for reaching out and creating connections. Student housings (Kollektiver) are often in a messy state and we were hoping that by creating a place to increase communication it would be easier to reach out and talk about improvement. </p>

                    <p>At the time I was very into reading self-help books. Wanting a companion platform to support my own <b>character developmen</b>t I created Self_Help. As a student myself, students’ wellbeing and mental health is important so I wanted a subtle approach to increase the mental state. Subtle reminder to eat around dinner time paired reminders to go outside and motivational words all have good intentions.  </p>

                    <p>The Digital Sustainability Diary is a tool designed to help students <b>engage </b>with and <b>reflect</b> on the UN's sustainability goals.

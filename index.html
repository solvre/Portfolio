                 <h3>What?</h3>
                 <p>Housemate HQ is a tool for student housings to get to know each other in a low stress environment. Essentially it’s a Speed friending application to reach out and match based off of interests and create activities with your new friends.</p>

                 <h3>Why?</h3>
                 <p>As we’ve seen and researched a decrease in attendance for social events and an increase in self-isolation, we wanted to lower the threshhold for reaching out and creating connections. Student housings (Kollektiver) are often in a messy state and we were hoping that by creating a place to increase communication it would be easier to reach out and talk about improvement. </p>

                 <h3>Why?</h3>
                 <p>At the time I was very into reading self-help books. Wanting a companion platform to support my own character development I created Self_Help. As a student myself, students’ wellbeing and mental health is important so I wanted a subtle approach to increase the mental state. Subtle reminder to eat around dinner time paired reminders to go outside and motivational words all have good intentions.  </p>

                 <h3>How?</h3>
                 <p>This light and dark mode supported platform is enhanced from the original project goals with new technology I learned as the year went by. Now using Web Component to recommend weekly activities from a JSON file it now supports a bigger project.</p>

                 <p>The diary was primary built as a learning tool for sustainability. To raise awareness and help reflective learning. As sustainability is a highly relevant goal we aim to contribute to, the page is also built sustainable with conscious choices in terms of image usage. </p>
